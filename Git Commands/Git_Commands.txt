Git was created by the Linux creator 'Linus Torval'
on April of 2005;
GitHub was launched in 2008 to host Git repositories;

Important attribute of git is it's version control System called the "distributed version control".
-different users (or teams of users) maintain their own repositories, instead of working from a central repository.
-changes are stored as 'change sets' or 'patches'.
   -tracks changes, not versions
   -different from CVS and SVN, which track versions.
   -change sets can be exchanged between repositories.
